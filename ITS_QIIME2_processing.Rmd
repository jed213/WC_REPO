This is the QIIME2 analysis for the Whooping Crane project ITS sequences. Many samples were sequenced a second time to correct for batch effects, and these will be identified by ending in -1 or -2 depending on the sequencing run it came from.

There were two separate runs which together cover all tracheal samples from the cranes.  

**Run 1**

* Date: 09.25.2023
* 62 total samples (124 total sequence files)
  + 57 samples (including donor and inoculum)
  + 3 extraction blanks
  + 2 PCR negatives
* 11 samples were resequenced at the core, including all blanks and negatives

**Run 2**

* Date: 07.29.2024
* __ total samples (__ total sequence files)
  + __ new samples
  + __ repeated samples for batch effects correction
